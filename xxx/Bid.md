We need help with vertex shaders in our threejs app.

We want to add the control segments "Blob Noise" and "Blob Surface noise" from
https://blobmixer.14islands.com/remix

to our project:
https://codesandbox.io/s/wobbling-sphere-cont-forked-e6my2l

The source code of the blobmixer website is on github:
https://github.com/hansenconnor/blob-mixer

We have already attempted to implement the vertex shader, but we have some difficulties.
In this sandbox you can see the attempt.
https://codesandbox.io/s/sphere-deformation-shader-forked-ggldm6

The issues are:
The slider "surface frequency" does not do the same as on the repo project

The two PoleAmount Sliders dont work as expected.


Deliverables
Implement the functionality of the
"Blob Noise" and "Blob Surface noise" sliders from
https://blobmixer.14islands.com/remix
to our project:
https://codesandbox.io/s/wobbling-sphere-cont-forked-e6my2l.

You can use our implementation of the vertex shader: https://codesandbox.io/s/sphere-deformation-shader-forked-ggldm6

and fix the discussed issues.

As a result we want a codesandbox that is forked from ours, with the sliders working and the transition between slider settings to be the same as on the blobmixer site. (smooth transition between states).

## ref
Failed to deliver the project and also got upset when I wouldn't check a link to a Google Doc that he shared - where he started trying to type to me outside of Freelancer.com. When I refused to chat with him in that document, he stopped actively responding about the project and everything that he was positive about before became negative. Very suspicious freelancer that other clients need to be careful of.
